        <h1 class="fg-color-1">Wireguard VPN server</h1>

        <p>The VPN server can be configured to route all the traffic from the client, or to restrict the traffic to the
        server itself. In both case, both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are fully supported.</p>

        <h2>Operating modes</h2>

        <h3>Basic mode</h3>
        <p>
            Also known as split tunneling, this mode only enforce the VPN to access the server services, the other
            traffic goes through the client’s standard gateway.
        </p>

        <h3>Enforce traffic</h3>
        <p>
            In this mode, all the traffic is passing through the server, completely hiding the client IP address.
        </p>

        <h2>Advantages</h2>

        <h3>Restrict authentication services to the VPN</h3>

        <p>
            Once the VPN is installed, you can the configure some of the system services, like postfix submission,
            dovecot imap and pop3 access, jabber, grafana, webdav, etc... to be only accessible through the VPN.
            While these services are secure, exposing them on internet sometimes generate a lot of traffic from bots
            trying various password brute force attacks.
        </p>

        <h3>Second layer of protection</h3>
        <p>
            This is also protecting you if your server is targetted by more advanced attacks methods, like zero-day
            or unknown vulnerabilities.
        </p>

        <h3>Bypass DNS filtering from ISPs</h3>
        <p>
            Some internet service providers are a fittlering or even altering DNS answers, or sometimes enforcing their
            specific DNS servers, notoriously insecure. The DNS server used by the VPN validates DNSSEC records, does
            not alter the responses, and does not share access logs with any government organisation.
        </p>

        <h2>Clients configuration</h2>

        <p>When running the playbook, the client configuration files are generated in the <em>archives</em> folder for
        each user, therefore, accessible through any WebDAV client.</p>

        <h2>Full IPv6 support</h2>
        <p>
            The VPN also offers you static IP addresses, both in IPv4 and IPv6, which can be useful when you need
            one. The support for IPv6 is complete and does not require any specific configuration, on desktop or on a
            mobile phone.
