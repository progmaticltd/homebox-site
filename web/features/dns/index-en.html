                <p>The DNS server is implemented using PowerDNS, one of the leading DNS server implemented, which provides
                    strong security and reliability. The chosen backend is a simple SQLite database, providing simplicity
                    and performance for this single server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also possible to use third party DNS mirrors, that will safely and securely replicate your DNS
                    content if needed.

                <p>
                    The DNS server implements DNSSEC out of the box. This means that you are protected against cache
                    poisoning, as each records will be digitally signed.

                <p>
                    DANE records are created as well, especially for the mail and Jabber related records.
                    DANE means <dfn>DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities</dfn>, and will enforce the traffic
                    between your mail server and the other ones to use encryption.

                <h2 class="color-primary-1">SSHFP records</h2>
                <p>A Secure Shell fingerprint record (abbreviated as SSHFP record) is a type of resource record in the
                which publishes and signs public SSH keys associated with your server. This constitute
                a better solution than blindly accepting public keys the first time you login on a server using SSH.

                <h2 class="color-primary-1">CAA records</h2>
                <p>
                    CAA records are created as well, to prevent any third party to create records using another
                    cetificate authority than LetsEncrypt.

                <h2 class="color-primary-1">Catchall record</h2>
                <p>
                    By default, a “catch-all” record will be created, redirecting all queries to your domains to your
                    server. This let you create wildcard certificates with LetsEncrypt as well, using the DNS challenge.
