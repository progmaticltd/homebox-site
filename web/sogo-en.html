                SOGo is a web interface allowing multiple tasks, from a desktop computer or a mobile device.
                You can also set-up two factors authentication for additional security.
                What you can do:
            </p>

                <li>Compose and send emails.</li>
                <li>Access your calendars, share or delegate them with other members, or even subscribe to online calendars.</li>
