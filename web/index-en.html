            <p>Homebox is a free and open source self-hosting solution, based on Debian GNU/Linux. It let you manage
                your personal information like your emails, your contacts, your calendars and even more, in a safest but
                still simplest possible way.  It is particularly well suited for families and small communities.
            </p>

            <p>This project is for you if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You are interested to host your emails and personal information yourself, for privacy, security, freedom, fun, etc.</li>
                <li>You want your server to be secure against both physical and remote intrusion.</li>
                <li>You want a low maintenance system, that keep itself updated automatically.</li>
                <li>You trust the Debian community to publish security updates.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It is using a set of Ansible scripts to setup the whole platform from a freshly installed Debian server.
                Therefore, you need to be familiar with Ansible and the command line.
                The system can be installed on a stand-alone server at home, or on a dedicated or virtual server hosted online.</p>
