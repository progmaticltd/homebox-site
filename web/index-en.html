            <p>Homebox is a free and open source self-hosting solution, based on Debian GNU/Linux. It let you manage
                your personal information like your emails, your contacts, your calendars and even more, in a safest but
                still simplest possible way.  It is particularly well suited for families and small communities.  It is
                a solution optmised for <em>daily usage</em> rather than development.

                    installed Debian server.  Therefore, you need to be familiar with Ansible and the command line.  The
                    system can be installed on a stand-alone server at home, or on a dedicated or virtual server hosted
                    online.</p>
