                Hello,

                Your certificate (or certificates) for the names listed below will expire in 19 days (on 2024-02-24). Please make sure to renew your certificate before then, or visitors to your web site will encounter errors.

                We recommend renewing certificates automatically when they have a third of their total lifetime left. For Let's Encrypt's current 90-day certificates, that means renewing 30 days before expiration. See https://letsencrypt.org/docs/integration-guide/ for details.

                pop3.homebox.space
                smtp.homebox.space

                For details about when we send these emails, please visit: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/expiration-emails/ In particular, note that this reminder email is still sent if you've obtained a slightly different certificate by adding or removing names. If you've replaced this certificate with a newer one that covers more or fewer names than the list above, you may be able to ignore this message.

                For any questions or support, please visit: https://community.letsencrypt.org/ Unfortunately, we can't provide support by email.

                If you are receiving this email in error, unsubscribe at:
                  http://delivery.letsencrypt.org/track/unsub.php***
                Please note that this would also unsubscribe you from other Let's Encrypt service notices, including expiration reminders for any other certificates.
